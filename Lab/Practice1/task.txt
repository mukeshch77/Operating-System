File permission in Unix / Linux

	1. Owner
	2. Group of users
	3. All the other users

-> read = r
-> write = w
-> execute = x

File permission are shown in a 10 character string.
The first character shows the type of file.
like:
	link = l
	directory = d
	file = -

ex: -rwxr-xr--
	here :  - = shows type of file
		rwx = owner permission
		r-x = group of users permission
		r-- = all the user permission

Changing the file permission

	*chmod

-> we can change file permission using chmod through the use of symbolic and numeric modes.

Owner represented by (u) = chmod u+w file_name
Group represented by (g) = chmod g-r file_name
other represented by (o) = chmod o+x file_name
All the three category represented by (a) = chmod a=r file_name
